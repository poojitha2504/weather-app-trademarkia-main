### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To run the project 

<b>Yarn<b> is a package manager that is faster and more predictable than <b>npm<b>, with better performance and a more user-friendly interface. Yarn uses a parallel download process, a lockfile for consistency, and an optimized dependency resolution algorithm for complex dependency trees.
Thus here we suggest to run yarn commands rather than npm, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Run the above command to install the dependencies required to run this project

### `yarn run`

After installing all the dependencies run this command for running the project.This will give options like: start, build, eject.

### `start`

Now write start for running the project in your local host.
